# Accelerometer Project
This repo contains my MATLAB R2015a code for my BME 7022 project involving using accelerometer data to calculate the number of steps taken.

## Description
This project aimed to test the effectiveness of a Samsung Galaxy smartphone accelerator at different placements on the body.

An algorithm was developed to extract the number of steps taken by analyzed peaks in the recorded signals. Test signals, with known step counts, were used to verify the accuracy of the model.

Experimental data was acquired on a treadmill, with different points of smartphone attachment and ambulatory intensity. Measurements from the smartphone accelerometer continuously measured 3-dimensional acceleration, which were then used to determine step counts for each condition.

## Result Summary
As expected, the ideal location for accelerometer attachment was at the ankle. Also, ambulatory intensity consistently showed that more gentle ambulation led to more accurate estimates for step counts with the developed algorithm.
